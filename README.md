#Phase 1 Project

This project showcases a companyâ€™s (AR_Air) problem in its expansion to diversify its portfolio by informing on the potential risks for the new venture through a data-driven approach. The data outcomes are then used to recommend to AR_Air's management the lowest-risk airplanes to be purchased for their operations.
