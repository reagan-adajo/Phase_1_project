#Phase 1 Project

This project showcases a company’s (AR_Air) problem in its expansion to diversify its portfolio by informing on the potential risks for the new venture through a data-driven approach. The data outcomes are then used to recommend to AR_Air's management the lowest-risk airplanes to be purchased for their operations.

#Business Problem
    AR_Air is deliberate on its expansion plans but challenged about the risks involved in 
executing them. Thus, the need to gain more knowledge for a better understanding and 
development of actionable insights
#Business Aim
 • To diversify the business portfolio by venturing into air transport business
 Business Interest
 • To purchase and operate airplanes for private and commercial enterprises
#Business Questions/Metrics
 • Howoften do airplanes cause accidents (annually)?
 • What type of airplanes are more prone to accidents for private and/or commercial flights?
 • What are the major causes of airplane accidents?
#Business Gap
 • AR_Air needs to know the potential risks of aircraft, with emphasis on airplanes, to suit their 
interests, address the objective, and answer their queries

RECOMMENDATIONS

    Future airplane accidents should not be predicted from the previous years since no correlation 
exists. 
    A wide range of airplanes of makes with low risks exist that AR_Air should consider for their private 
and commercial operations, such as Degraw, LEINEKE WALTER L, DOVA AIRCRAFT SRO, 
DARROW, STEPHEN TAYLORCRAFT CORP, etc
    AR_Air should invest in continuous professional development among pilots to reduce aviation 
accidents.
    Purchase and operations decisions for air transport ventures should not be made solely on safety 
data
    More research is required for better decision-making in the new venture
